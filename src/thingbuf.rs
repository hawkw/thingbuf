/// A fixed-size, lock-free, multi-producer multi-consumer (MPMC) queue.
///
/// This is a fixed-capacity, first-in, first-out data structure. Elements are
/// enqueued at the front of the queue by calling the [`push`] method, and
/// dequeued from the end of the queue by calling the [`pop`] method. Elements
/// may be enqueued and dequeued from a `ThingBuf` concurrently by any number of
/// threads or asynchronous tasks.
///
/// This queue is an implementation of a [design by Dmitry Vyukov][vyukov] of
/// 1024cores.net.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use thingbuf::ThingBuf;
///
/// let q = ThingBuf::new(2);
///
/// // Push some values to the queue.
/// q.push(1).unwrap();
/// q.push(2).unwrap();
///
/// // Now, the queue is at capacity.
/// assert!(q.push(3).is_err());
/// ```
///
/// # Allocation
///
/// A `ThingBuf` is a fixed-size, array-based queue. Elements in the queue are
/// stored in a single array whose capacity is specified when the `ThingBuf` is
/// constructed. This means that a `ThingBuf` requires only a single heap
/// allocation over its entire lifespan. Calling [`ThingBuf::new`] will allocate
/// an array to store `capacity` elements. Subsequent calls to [`push`] and
/// [`pop`] will never allocate or deallocate memory.
///
/// If the size of the queue is known at compile-time, the [`StaticThingBuf`]
/// type, which requires *no* heap allocations at all, can be used instead.
///
/// ## Reusing Allocations
///
/// Of course, if the *elements* in the queue are themselves heap-allocated
/// (such as `String`s or `Vec`s), heap allocations and deallocations may still
/// occur when those types are created or dropped. However, `ThingBuf` also
/// provides an API for enqueueing and dequeueing elements *by reference*. In
/// some use cases, this API can be used to reduce allocations for queue elements.
///
/// As an example, consider the case where multiple threads in a program format
/// log messages and send them to a dedicated worker thread that writes those
/// messages to a file. A naive implementation might look something like this:
///
/// ```rust
/// use thingbuf::ThingBuf;
/// use std::{sync::Arc, fmt, thread, fs::File, error::Error, io::Write};
///
/// // Called by application threads to log a message.
/// fn log_event(q: &Arc<ThingBuf<String>>, message: &dyn fmt::Debug) {
///     // Format the log line to a `String`.
///     let line = format!("{:?}\n", message);
///     // Send the string to the worker thread.
///     let _ = q.push(line);
///     // If the queue was full, ignore the error and drop the log line.
/// }
///
/// fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
/// # // wrap the actual code in a function that's never called so that running
/// # // the test never actually creates the log file.
/// # fn docs() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
///     let log_queue = Arc::new(ThingBuf::<String>::new(1024));
///
///     // Spawn the background worker thread.
///     let q = log_queue.clone();
///     let mut file = File::create("myapp.log")?;
///     thread::spawn(move || {
///         use std::io::Write;
///         loop {
///             // Pop from the queue, and write each log line to the file.
///             while let Some(line) = q.pop() {
///                 file.write_all(line.as_bytes()).unwrap();
///             }
///
///             // No more messages in the queue!
///             file.flush().unwrap();
///             thread::yield_now();
///         }
///     });
///
///     // ...
///     # Ok(())
/// # }
/// # Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// With this design, however, new `String`s are allocated for every message
/// that's logged, and then are immediately deallocated once they are written to
/// the file. This can have a negative performance impact.
///
/// Using `ThingBuf`'s [`push_ref`] and [`pop_ref`] methods, this code can be
/// redesigned to _reuse_ `String` allocations in place. With these methods,
/// rather than moving an element by-value into the queue when enqueueing, we
/// instead reserve the rights to _mutate_ a slot in the queue in place,
/// returning a [`Ref`]. Similarly, when dequeueing, we also recieve a [`Ref`]
/// that allows reading from (and mutating) the dequeued element. This allows
/// the queue to _own_ the set of `String`s used for formatting log messages,
/// which are cleared in place and the existing allocation reused.
///
/// The rewritten code might look like this:
///
/// ```rust
/// use thingbuf::ThingBuf;
/// use std::{sync::Arc, fmt, thread, fs::File, error::Error};
///
/// // Called by application threads to log a message.
/// fn log_event(q: &Arc<ThingBuf<String>>, message: &dyn fmt::Debug) {
///     use std::fmt::Write;
///
///     // Reserve a slot in the queue to write to.
///     if let Ok(mut slot) = q.push_ref() {
///         // Clear the string in place, retaining the allocated capacity.
///         slot.clear();
///         // Write the log message to the string.
///         write!(&mut *slot, "{:?}\n", message);
///     }
///     // Otherwise, if `push_ref` returns an error, the queue is full;
///     // ignore this log line.
/// }
///
/// fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
/// # // wrap the actual code in a function that's never called so that running
/// # // the test never actually creates the log file.
/// # fn docs() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
///     let log_queue = Arc::new(ThingBuf::<String>::new(1024));
///
///     // Spawn the background worker thread.
///     let q = log_queue.clone();
///     let mut file = File::create("myapp.log")?;
///     thread::spawn(move || {
///         use std::io::Write;
///         loop {
///             // Pop from the queue, and write each log line to the file.
///             while let Some(line) = q.pop_ref() {
///                 file.write_all(line.as_bytes()).unwrap();
///             }
///
///             // No more messages in the queue!
///             file.flush().unwrap();
///             thread::yield_now();
///         }
///     });
///
///     // ...
///     # Ok(())
/// # }
/// # Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this implementation, the strings will only be reallocated if their
/// current capacity is not large enough to store the formatted representation
/// of the log message.
