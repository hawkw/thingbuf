/// A queue of waiters ([`core::task::Waker`]s or [`std;:thread::Thread`]s)
/// implemented as a doubly-linked intrusive list.
///
/// The *[intrusive]* aspect of this list is important, as it means that it does
/// not allocate memory. Instead, nodes in the linked list are stored in the
/// futures of tasks trying to wait for capacity, or on the stack frames of
/// threads blocking on channel capacity.
///
/// Using an intrusive list is critical if the MPSC is to *truly* have bounded
/// memory use: if the channel has capacity for a bounded number of *messages*,
/// but when it is full, must allocate memory to store the threads or tasks that
/// are waiting to send messages, it does not actually bound the maximum amount
/// of memory used by the channel! This is, potentially, quite bad, as
/// increasing backpressure can cause out of memory conditions.
///
/// Also, not allocating can have a performance advantage, since tasks waiting
/// for capacity will never hit `malloc` or `free`. This reduces the overhead of
/// waiting, but (more importantly!) it also avoids allocator churn that can
/// hurt `malloc` performance for *other* parts of the program that need to
/// allocate memory.
///
/// Finally, this will allow using a `ThingBuf` MPSC channel with exclusively
/// static allocations, making it much easier to use in embedded systems or on
/// bare metal when an allocator may not always be available.
///
/// However, the intrusive linked list introduces one new danger: because
/// futures can be *cancelled*, and the linked list nodes live within the
/// futures trying to wait for channel capacity, we *must* ensure that the node
/// is unlinked from the list before dropping a cancelled future. Failure to do
/// so would result in the list containing dangling pointers. Therefore, we must
/// use a *doubly-linked* list, so that nodes can edit both the previous and
/// next node when they have to remove themselves. This is kind of a bummer, as
/// it means we can't use something nice like this [intrusive queue by Dmitry
/// Vyukov][2], and there are not really practical designs for lock-free
/// doubly-linked lists that don't rely on some kind of deferred reclamation
/// scheme such as hazard pointers or QSBR.
///
/// Instead, we just stick a mutex around the linked list, which must be
/// acquired to pop nodes from it, or for nodes to remove themselves when
/// futures are cancelled. This is a bit sad, but the critical sections for this
/// mutex are short enough that we still get pretty good performance despite it.
///
/// A spinlock is used on `no_std` platforms; [`std::sync::Mutex`] is used when
/// the standard library is available.
